## Search URL + Status

- 2025-09-06 02:48:42: Added buildPolymarketSearchURL helper with unit tests; normalized market status in normalizeMarket; updated test:unit to include new tests; all unit tests passing.

## HTTP Client

- 2025-09-06 02:49:19: Introduced HttpPolymarketClient with injectable fetch; unit tests verify URL building and JSON handling without network.

## Handlers + PRD Status

- 2025-09-06 02:59:24: Added pure handleSearch and tests; marked PRD acceptance: (1) search returns normalized fields; (2) market URL resolves to slug/id and loads metadata via /api/market. All unit tests passing.

## Search options

- 2025-09-06 03:02:14: Added support for limit/types on /api/search. Handler parses values; client and interface accept options; unit tests cover option passing. Configured pretest:unit to build TS before tests.

## MVP snapshot data ready

- 2025-09-06 03:08:31: Implemented discovery endpoints and core HTTP snapshots: /api/search (with limit/types), /api/resolve + /api/market (detail), /api/price, /api/midpoint, /api/book, /api/trades. Added URL builders and HttpPolymarketClient methods. All unit tests passing (23).
