## PRD Kickoff

- 2025-09-06 02:46:10: Start PRD execution: ingest tasks into phase 1; add URL/slug/id parsing helper (extractMarketRef) with unit tests; unit tests pass.

## Handlers + PRD Status

- 2025-09-06 02:59:24: Added pure handleSearch and tests; marked PRD acceptance: (1) search returns normalized fields; (2) market URL resolves to slug/id and loads metadata via /api/market. All unit tests passing.

## MVP snapshot data ready
