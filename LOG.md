## PRD Kickoff

- 2025-09-06 02:46:10: Start PRD execution: ingest tasks into phase 1; add URL/slug/id parsing helper (extractMarketRef) with unit tests; unit tests pass.

## Handlers + PRD Status

- 2025-09-06 02:59:24: Added pure handleSearch and tests; marked PRD acceptance: (1) search returns normalized fields; (2) market URL resolves to slug/id and loads metadata via /api/market. All unit tests passing.

## MVP snapshot data ready

- 2025-09-06 03:08:31: Implemented discovery endpoints and core HTTP snapshots: /api/search (with limit/types), /api/resolve + /api/market (detail), /api/price, /api/midpoint, /api/book, /api/trades. Added URL builders and HttpPolymarketClient methods. All unit tests passing (23).

## Spreads endpoint

- 2025-09-06 04:00:00: Added `/api/spread` that prefers upstream spreads but derives from top-of-book when absent; implemented client `getSpreads` and `buildGetSpreadsURL`. Added unit tests for URL builder, client normalization, and handler (both paths). All unit tests passing (34).
